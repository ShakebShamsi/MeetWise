## 📅 What Is This App?

**Think of MeetWise as your personal scheduling assistant** — but one that never sleeps and never double-books you.

Here's how it works in plain English:

### For Hosts (You)
1. **Set your availability** — Use a visual calendar to drag and create time blocks when you're free for meetings
2. **Connect your Google Calendar** — MeetWise reads your existing events so it never shows a time when you're already busy
3. **Create meeting types** — Define different kinds of meetings (15-min quick chat, 30-min consultation, 60-min deep dive)
4. **Share your booking link** — Send `yoursite.com/book/your-name` to anyone who wants to meet

### For Guests (People booking with you)
1. Visit your public booking page
2. See only the times you're actually available
3. Pick a slot and enter their name + email
4. Get a Google Calendar invite with a Google Meet link automatically

### Perfect For
- **Freelancers** scheduling client calls
- **Consultants** managing discovery sessions
- **Coaches & Tutors** booking 1-on-1 sessions
- **Developers** learning to build SaaS products

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with these variables:

```bash
# ===========================================
# CLERK - Authentication & Billing
# ===========================================
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

# ===========================================
# SANITY - Content Management
# ===========================================
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION=2026-01-07
SANITY_API_TOKEN=sk...

# ===========================================
# GOOGLE - Calendar API
# ===========================================
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=GOCSPX-...
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/calendar/callback
```

### Security Notes

> ⚠️ **Important Security Rules**
>
> - **NEVER commit `.env.local`** to version control
> - Variables starting with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are exposed to the browser — only use for non-sensitive values
> - Keep `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, `SANITY_API_TOKEN`, and Google credentials server-side only
> - For production, update `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` to your production URL

## 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

### Authentication Issues

**Problem:** Redirect loop after signing in
```
Solution: Check that your Clerk middleware is configured correctly 
and your publishable key matches your environment.
```

**Problem:** "Unauthorized" errors on protected routes
```
Solution: Ensure clerkMiddleware() is running and the route 
isn't accidentally excluded in the matcher config.
```

### Google Calendar Issues

**Problem:** OAuth error "redirect_uri_mismatch"
```
Solution: The redirect URI in Google Cloud Console must 
EXACTLY match GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI in your .env.local
(including http vs https and trailing slashes).
```

**Problem:** "Token has been expired or revoked"
```
Solution: The automatic token refresh may have failed. 
Ask the user to disconnect and reconnect their Google account.
```

**Problem:** Calendar events not showing busy times
```
Solution: Ensure the Google account has calendar events 
with "Busy" status (not "Free"). All-day events are 
intentionally skipped.
```

### Sanity Issues

**Problem:** "Warning: SANITY_API_TOKEN is not set"
```
Solution: Add a valid Sanity API token with Editor 
permissions to your .env.local file.
```

**Problem:** CORS errors when fetching from Sanity
```
Solution: Add your domain to CORS origins in Sanity 
project settings (sanity.io/manage).
```

### Development Issues

**Problem:** Port 3000 already in use
```bash
# Find and kill the process
lsof -i :3000
kill -9 <PID>

# Or use a different port
pnpm dev -- -p 3001
```

**Problem:** TypeScript errors after schema changes
```bash
# Regenerate types
pnpm typegen
```
